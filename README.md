# Readme-Generator

## Description
The goal of this project is to quickly and easily create a README file by using a command-line application to generate one. To allow project creators more time devoted to working on the project rather than a README. This command-line app can dynamically generate a README.md file from the user's input using the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4).

## Install
Download the file from my github and install node!

THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
WHEN you choose a license for the application from a list of options
THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under
WHEN you enter your GitHub username
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile
